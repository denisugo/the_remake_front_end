# The remake (front-end)

## Important note!

herokuapp.com is included in the Mozilla Foundationâ€™s Public Suffix List. This list is used in recent versions of several browsers, such as Firefox, Chrome and Opera, to limit how broadly a cookie may be scoped. In other words, in browsers that support the functionality, applications in the herokuapp.com domain are prevented from setting cookies for _.herokuapp.com. Note that _.herokuapp.com cookies can currently be set in Internet Explorer, but this behavior should not be relied upon and may change in the future.

Therefore this app doesn't have an ability to set all necessary cookies while it is hosted on Heroku with an its default domain.

## Overview

This is the remake of my previous portfolio project. It is aimed for improving all the cons of the project. The Sql database remains the same, back-end part should be slightly upgraded, front-end will also get more features.

## Features

- JWT instead of redux
- Oauth
- Description of each function
- Simple back-end structure

## Comment styling

- // Should be used for commenting unused parts of code
- //\* Should be used for short describing of code parts, generally for introductions
- //? Should be used for more detailed describing of code
- // TODO: Should be used for leaving certain tasks within code
- //! Should be used for indicating of high priority notes

## Roadmap

### Front-end

- Refactor and add a fully functional validation on inputs
- Comment each component
- JWT should expire

### Back-end

- Refactor all middlewares
- Remove roles in SQL, so it can be published onto Heroku
- Cookie session should expire
- Get rid of query tests and refactor middleware tests

## Getting Started

This app was build with Next js framework, tested with Jest and Selenium.

Docs could be found in _Docs_ folder.

### Links

This is the client app. It should work with [this API](https://github.com/denisugo/the_remake_back-end)

You can also check this project out [at](https://frontend-portfolio-app.herokuapp.com)

## Pros

- Lightwight
- SEO friendly
- A11y friendly
- Good color combination

## Pros & Cons

### Cons

- Poor design: Because of time pressure, I was unable to create very elaborate elements, high fidelity wireframings and a mobile (tablet) version of the app. So that it is just a Next js showcase project.

### Pros

- Anything else

### TODO:

- Improve design.
- Catch mistakes in components.
- Allow user to delete their account.
- Recreate all components that contains `form ` item. It is importtant for the following todo.
- Improve tests. Some tests requirs _teardown_ phase. Not all component have 100% test coverage.
- Add mobile version
