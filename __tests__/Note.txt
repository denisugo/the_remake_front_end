This app has two versions: mobile and desktop. Therefore, some tests
should be divided into two separated test suits: one for mobile and
one for desktop. 

Those tests have "wrapper issue": if a test requires a call to wrapper.update(),
it should not modify a wrapper object.
So, findByComponent("[Desktop or Mobile component name]", wrapper).first().dive()
should be used within a test body. If a test doesn't require an update of a wrapper
object, then redefining of wrapper with
wrapper = findByComponent("CartDesktop", wrapper).first().dive();
within beforeEach(...) is allowed.
